# NAME

Config::Role - Moose config attribute loaded from file in home dir

# VERSION

version 0.1.1

# SYNOPSIS

    package My::Class;
    use Moose;
    with 'Config::Role';

    # Read configuration from ~/.my_class.ini, available in $self->config
    # This is optional if you like this particular naming of the file
    has 'config_filename' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', lazy_build => 1 );
    sub _build_config_filename { '.my_class.ini' }

    # Fetch a value from the configuration, allow constructor override
    has 'username' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', lazy_build => 1 );
    sub _build_username { return (shift)->config->{'username'}; }

    sub make_request {
        my ($self) = @_;
        my $response = My::Class::Request->make(
            username => $self->username,
            ...
        );
        ...
    }

# RATIONALE

This is the problem Config::Role was created to solve: Give me a config
attribute (hashref) which is read from a file in my home directory to give
other attributes default values, with configurability to choose the file's
location and name.

# DESCRIPTION

Config::Role is a very basic role you can add to your Moose class that
allows it to take configuration data from a file located in your home
directory instead of always requiring parameters to be specified in the
constructor.

The synopsis shows how you can read the value of `username` from the file
`.my_class.ini` located in the home directory of the current user.  The
location of the file is determined by whatever `File::HomeDir->my_data`
returns for your particular platform.

The config file is loaded by using [Config::Any](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::Any)'s `load_files()` method.
It will load the files specified in the `config_files` attribute.  By
default this is an array reference that contains the filename from the
`config_file` attribute.  If you specify multiple files which both contain
the same configuration key, the value is loaded from the first file.  That
is, the most significant file should be first in the array.

The `Config::Any->load_files()` flag `use_ext` is set to a true value, so you
can use any configuration file format supported by [Config::Any](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::Any) by just
specifying the common filename extension for the format.

# ATTRIBUTES

## config_dir

The directory where the configuration file is located. A Path::Class::Dir
object.  Defaults to `File::HomeDir->my_data`.  Allows coercion from
Str.

## config_file

The filename the configuration is read from. A Path::Class::File object.
Allows coercion from Str.  Default is calculated based on the composing
class name.  If your composing class is called `My::Class` it will be
`.my_class.ini`.  Remember that if you sub-class the composing class, the
default will be the name of the sub-class, not the super-class.

## config_files

The collection of filenames the configuration is read from. Array reference
of [Path::Class::File](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Path::Class::File) objects.  Allows coercion from an array reference of
strings.

## config

A hash reference that holds the compiled configuration read from the
specified files.

# METHODS

## config_filename

Optional attribute or method on the composing class. Should return a string
with the name of the configuration file name.  See `config_file` for
how the default is calculated if this method is not available.

# COMPARISON TO [MooseX::ConfigFromFile](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::ConfigFromFile)

Config::Role doesn't require you to use anything else than `$class->new()` to
actually get the benefit of automatic config loading.  Someone might see this as
negative, as it gives a minor performance penalty even if the config file is
not present.

Config::Role uses [File::HomeDir](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::HomeDir) to default to a known location, so you
only need to specify the file name you use, not a full path.  This should
give better cross-platform compatibility, together with the use of
Path::Class for all file system manipulation.

Also, with Config::Role you must explicitly specify in the builder of an
attribute that you want to use values from the config file.
MooseX::ConfigFromFile seems to do that for you.  You also get the benefit
that the configuration file keys and the class attribute names does not need
to map 1-to-1 (someone will probably see that as a bad thing).

Otherwise they are pretty similar in terms of what they do.

# TODO

- A nicely named sugar function could be exported to allow less boilerplate
in generating attributes that default to config values.
